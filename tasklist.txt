Arduino

To do
- Implement logic: If three concective similar messages, then do (move/stop steering)

Done


Raspberry Pi

To do
- Figure out plan B
- Confiugure the new compute unit (accelerator)
- Integerate the human detection with lane detection (new detect function with human detection part)
- Figure out a more autonomus way to start the self driving mode on the raspberry pi

Done

- Show two center points on the image


Git

To do

- Initialize repo

Done




Limitations
- Wide lens camera
- Higher computationally capable compute unit (raspberry pi) - Before the accelerator, the inference time was 2.4s on 15FPS video with 320x320 pixel images




Functionalities
- Raspberry pi is the compute unit and arduino is the hardware control unit
- Message error proofing: The arduino waits for 3 consecutive similar messages before passing instructions to the motors
- The raspberry has a safety offset of 20 pixels before changing the steering direction
